- **Login:** Users can log in using their email and password. Upon successful login, an **access token** and a **refresh token** are issued to the user.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** The **access token** is used for making authenticated requests to the server, while the **refresh token** is used to obtain a new **access token** when the old one expires.
- **Persistent Sessions:** The **access token** is stored in memory or local storage (e.g., sessionStorage), and the **refresh token** is stored securely (preferably in HTTP-only cookies).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access to certain routes and data is restricted based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

#### **How It Works:**

1. **Sign Up:**
   - The user registers by providing their **name**, **email**, and **password**.
   - After registration, an **OTP** is sent to the user's email for verification. The user must input the OTP to confirm their email.
   - Upon successful verification, the user‚Äôs account is created and they can proceed to log in.

2. **Login:**
   - The user logs in by entering their **email** and **password**.
   - On successful login, the backend issues two tokens:
     - **Access Token:** This token is used for making authenticated requests to the API.
     - **Refresh Token:** This token is used to obtain a new **access token** when the original one expires.
   - **Access Token** is stored in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** in the browser (for front-end applications), and the **Refresh Token** is stored in **HTTP-only cookies** for security.

3. **Token Storage:**
   - **Access Token:** This token typically has a short expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour). It is stored in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** on the client-side and is sent with each request to authenticate API calls.
   - **Refresh Token:** This token is more persistent and is stored in **HTTP-only cookies**. It is used to obtain a new **access token** after it expires. HTTP-only cookies help mitigate risks of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. **Token Expiration & Refresh Flow:**
   - **Access Token Expiry:** When the **access token** expires, the client sends the **refresh token** to the server to obtain a new **access token**.
   - **Refresh Token Expiry:** Refresh tokens are long-lived but also have an expiration time (e.g., 30 days). If the **refresh token** expires, the user needs to log in again.
   - **Refresh Token Flow:**
     - The client sends the expired **access token** along with the **refresh token** to the backend.
     - The backend validates the **refresh token** and issues a new **access token**.
     - The **new access token** is returned to the client for future requests.

5. **Authorization:**
   - The backend validates the **access token** before allowing access to protected routes.
   - **Role-based access control (RBAC)** is used to restrict access to certain pages or resources based on the user's role (e.g., admin or user).
   - **Admin-only routes** will be accessible only to users with an **admin** role, while regular users will only have access to their own data.

6. **Logout:**
   - To log out, the client deletes both the **access token** (from **localStorage** or **sessionStorage**) and the **refresh token** (from **HTTP-only cookies**).
   - After logout, the user is redirected to the login page.

#### **Flow of Authentication:**
1. **Sign Up:**
   - User submits their details and receives an OTP via email.
   - User inputs the OTP and successfully verifies their account.

2. **Login:**
   - User submits login credentials (email and password).
   - Backend issues both an **access token** and **refresh token**.
   - **Access token** is stored in **localStorage** or **sessionStorage** for use in subsequent requests.
   - **Refresh token** is stored in **HTTP-only cookies** for secure token refresh.

3. **Access Token Expiry and Refresh:**
   - The client periodically checks for **access token** expiry.
   - Upon expiration, the client sends the **refresh token** to the backend to request a new **access token**.
   - If successful, the backend returns a new **access token**, which the client stores for further requests.

4. **Authorization Flow:**
   - When the user attempts to access restricted resources or routes, the server verifies the **access token**.
   - Based on the role (admin or user), the server grants or denies access to specific resources.

5. **Logout:**
   - Client deletes the **access token** and **refresh token**.
   - The session is terminated and the user is redirected to the login page.

#### **Benefits of Access & Refresh Tokens System:**
- **Secure Authentication:** The **access token** ensures secure authentication for each request, while the **refresh token** allows users to maintain their session without re-authenticating frequently.
- **Persistent Sessions:** The **refresh token** allows users to stay logged in even after the **access token** expires, improving user experience.
- **Improved Security:** Storing **access tokens** in **localStorage** (or **sessionStorage**) and **refresh tokens** in **HTTP-only cookies** prevents exposure to XSS attacks and ensures secure handling of sensitive data.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Different user roles can be configured, ensuring that sensitive data and actions are protected and only accessible by authorized users.

#### **Technologies Used for Authentication:**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure token-based authentication.
- **Node.js/Express (Backend):** Handles user authentication requests, token generation, and validation.
- **bcryptjs:** Securely hashes passwords before storing them.
- **localStorage/sessionStorage:** Stores **access tokens** to maintain the user's session.
- **HTTP-only Cookies:** Used to securely store **refresh tokens** to prevent access from JavaScript.
- **Axios (Frontend):** Sends requests to the backend for login, signup, and token refresh.

By utilizing **access tokens** and **refresh tokens**, this authentication system provides a secure, scalable, and persistent way to manage user sessions, improve performance, and ensure that sensitive data remains protected. This flow also supports long-lasting user sessions with minimal reauthentication required, enhancing the overall user experience.
